# Go Backend API & Service Layer

**Note: The Makefile and DB workflow have been updated. See README and Makefile for new targets. docker-migrate-up/down have been removed. Use `make help` to discover all targets. Large/test output files are now ignored and removed from git.**

This feature tracks the next phase of backend development for Inbox Whisperer, following the principles in `developing.md`:
- Always working, tested code
- Separation of concerns (API, service, data)
- Structured logging and observability
- Modern, maintainable Go idioms

## Goals
- Use [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) for routing/middleware
- Replace gorilla/mux in main.go
- Add logging middleware and structured logging everywhere
- Scaffold config loading from environment
- Set up DB connection (pgx)
- Service layer for business logic
- Thin, validated API handlers
- Full test coverage for services and handlers

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Replace gorilla/mux with go-chi
- [x] Remove gorilla/mux dependency
- [x] Add go-chi to go.mod
- [x] Refactor `cmd/server/main.go` to use chi.Router
- [x] Implement `/healthz` endpoint
- [x] Add logging middleware using zerolog
- [x] Add basic integration test for healthz

### 2. Configuration & Environment
- [x] Create `pkg/config` for env/config loading
- [x] Add `.env.example` and update README
- [x] Test config loading

### 3. Database Layer
- [x] Implement DB connection using pgx (see `internal/data/db.go`)
- [x] Add repository interfaces and basic CRUD (User)
- [x] Add tests for data layer (unit + integration with testcontainers)
- [x] Integration test infra (testcontainers-go) implemented
- [x] Devcontainer updated for testcontainers-go

### 4. Service Layer
- [x] Scaffold service and repository interfaces for a sample entity (User)
- [x] Implement service structs/methods for core business logic
- [x] Integrate service layer into server
- [x] Add unit tests for services

---
**Status as of 2025-04-21:**
- All API, service, and data layer tests pass, including those using testcontainers and repository logic.
- Test infrastructure is robust and isolated; backend is ready for new features.
- The Makefile and DB workflow have been updatedâ€”see Makefile and README for new targets (docker-migrate-up/down removed, use make help).
- Large/test output files are now ignored and removed from git.
- See README for troubleshooting testcontainers in devcontainers.

---

**Note:**
- The data layer is currently Postgres-specific, but the service layer will depend on interfaces for future flexibility and testability. This keeps the app easy to refactor or extend to other backends later.
### 5. API Layer
- [x] Implement HTTP handlers (thin, just call service)
- [x] Add request validation
- [x] Add tests for handlers

---

**Update (2025-04-21):**
- UserHandler and endpoints for GET /users/{id} and POST /users are implemented and wired up in the server.
- Basic request validation (required fields, ID presence) added to handlers.
- Next: Add tests for handlers and service unit tests.

### 6. CI & Quality
- [x] Add Makefile targets for lint, test, and build (see Makefile for unified backend/frontend targets)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI

---

**All code must build and pass tests at every step.**

Progress is tracked here as we build out the production-ready Go backend.
