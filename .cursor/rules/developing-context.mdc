# Cursor Context: Project Development Principles

**Source:** docs/developing.md

## Project Overview
Inbox Whisperer is an AI-powered tool to help users achieve and maintain inbox zero, with a Go backend and a modern React frontend. The first feature is the Inbox Zero Helper, guiding users to triage and organize their Gmail inbox efficiently.

## Design System & Theme
- Modern, shiny dark gradient background
- DM Sans font (imported via web/public/fonts/dmsans.css)
- No glassmorphism or excessive shadows

## Testing
- All tests follow docs/testing.md
- Integration tests use testcontainers-go (never rely on local/external services)

## Local Development Workflow
- Use dev.env for local overrides
- Canonical workflows:
  - `make dev-deploy` (Kubernetes/kind)
  - `make dev-down` (cleanup)
- Only run scripts in scripts/dev-deploy.sh or Makefile targets directly
- All config is environment-variable driven

## MVP Focus
- Google OAuth2 login
- Fetch and view emails
- All endpoints described in OpenAPI (kept up-to-date)
- React SPA frontend, strict best practices, auto-generated OpenAPI client

## Core Workflow
1. Email fetching: Securely connect to Gmail, fetch emails, cache summaries, background sync
2. Categorization: AI sorts emails into Promotions/Ads, To Review, Important, Deferred
3. Guided cleanup: Users process each category in order
4. Goal: Only important/deferred emails remain in inbox

## Coding Principles
- Always use strict best practiced production grade coding standards, clean architecture, seperation of concerns
- **Backend:** RESTful API (go-chi), separation of concerns, clean code, interfaces/abstraction
- **Frontend:** React+Vite+TypeScript, DaisyUI/Tailwind, strict linting/formatting, modular structure, React Router, OpenAPI client

## Feature Development Workflow
- Each feature has a Markdown spec in docs/features/
- Implementation plan and checklist per feature
- AI tools update checklists and plans as work progresses

## Notes
- Large/test output files are ignored in git
- Use `make help` for all targets
- This context is maintained for AI and human contributors
